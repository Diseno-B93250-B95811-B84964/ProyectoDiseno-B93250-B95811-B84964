Game Rules

1. Throw the dice to decide who plays first - highest
 score goes first, if it's a draw, throw again.
2. Players take turns to throw three binary lots and 
move one of their pieces.
3. Only one piece may be moved per throw of the dice 
and pieces must always move forward around the track.
4. If a counter lands upon a square occupied by an 
opposing counter, the counter landed upon is sent off 
the board and must start again from the beginning.
5. This wil happen unless a player lands on a flower 
tile.
